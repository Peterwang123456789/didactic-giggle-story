I am so happy today because I found some money.

Even better, I found even more money in my other pants. I just can't believe
that I can't keep track of my money. 

On my way home, I bought lottery using only ten bucks, but I won a millon dollar prize. So I went home and told my story to my mom. She said that I'm the luckiest person in the world.
